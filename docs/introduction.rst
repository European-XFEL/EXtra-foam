Introduction
============

**karaboFAI** is a tool that provides on-line (real-time, as fast as the
calibration pipeline) and off-line data analysis and visualization
for experiments at European XFEL that require azimuthal integration
of diffraction data acquired with 2D detectors. It is now working with
AGIPD, LPD and JungFrau detectors.
