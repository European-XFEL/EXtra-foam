SPECIAL ANALYSIS SUITE
======================

Special analysis is a new concept introduced in the version 0.8.2.

There are two different work flows for special analysis:

- The special analysis will receive processed data from a main **EXtra-foam** instance;
- The special analysis is independent from the main instance and it directly receives
  data from a "Karabo bridge".

The special analysis suite can be started by typing

.. code-block:: bash

    extra-foam-special-suite TOPIC

in a terminal.
