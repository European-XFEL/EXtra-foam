* TODO[4/9]

- [ ] tool A to integrate azimuthally and create hdf5 file -> new file
  - [ ] one file per set (for now)

- [ ] tool B:
  - [ ] filename trainID pulseID -> shows corrected and uncorrected data
  - [ ] filename trainID -> shows corrected and uncorrected data for all pulses

- [X] put in repository (or take backup at least)

- [ ] 'deploy and demoâ€™; aim to do today at 15:00. Cyril should be present.

- [X] hand over to Cyril and Hans

- [X] extend tool A to include some statistics:
  - for given set and train ID, compute averages for each value of Q
    across the pulses

- [ ] factor out re-usable code

- [ ] tool C:
  - [ ] filenameOFF filenameON trainID pulseID -> computes difference and shows in plot
  - [ ] filenameOFF filenameON trainID -> computes difference and shows in plot for all pulses

- [X] take input location of files from command line

Test data files in /gpfs/exfel/data/group/cas/tmp/project-dmitry

* TODO 2 [/]
